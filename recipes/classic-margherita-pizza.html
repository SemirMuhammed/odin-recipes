    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Margherita Pizza is the epitome of Italian simplicity and elegance. This
      classic dish features a thin, crisp crust topped with a rich tomato
      sauce,creamy mozzarella cheese, and fragrant fresh basil leaves. The
      colors—red, white, and green—pay homage to the Italian flag, and the
      combination of flavors is both vibrant and comforting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legend has it that the pizza was named after Queen Margherita of Savoy,
      who was so enamored with the dish during a visit to Naples that it was
      christened in her honor
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Margherita Pizza is loved worldwide for its balance of fresh
      ingredients and straightforward preparation, making it a favorite for both
      weeknight dinners and special occasions.
