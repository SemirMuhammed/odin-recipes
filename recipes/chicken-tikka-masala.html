    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken Tikka Masala is a beloved dish that marries the smoky flavor of
      grilled marinated chicken with a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce.
      Originating from the Indian subcontinent and popularized in the UK, this
      curry is known for its bold spices and velvety texture. The chicken is
      first marinated in yogurt and spices, then grilled or broiled, and finally
      simmered in a luscious sauce infused with ginger, garlic, and garam
      masala.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect with rice or warm naan, Chicken Tikka Masala is a global favorite,
      celebrated for its balance of heat, tang, and creaminess.
